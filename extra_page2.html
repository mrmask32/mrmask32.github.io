      <ul>
          <li>Number of passengers</li>
          <li>Cargo space requirements</li>
          <li>Driving conditions (city, highway, off-road)</li>
          <li>Fuel efficiency</li>
          <li>Desired features (safety, technology, comfort)</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Then, establish a realistic budget, including the purchase price, insurance, maintenance, and fuel costs.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Research Vehicle Types</h2>
      <p>Explore different vehicle types to find one that matches your needs:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Sedans: Good for fuel efficiency and everyday driving.</li>
          <li>SUVs: Offer more space and versatility.</li>
          <li>Trucks: Ideal for hauling and towing.</li>
          <li>Hatchbacks: Compact and practical.</li>

          <li>Electric Vehicles (EVs): Eco-friendly and fuel-efficient.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Evaluate Reliability and Safety</h2>
      <p>Check reliability ratings from reputable sources (e.g., Consumer Reports, J.D. Power). Look for safety features such as:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>Anti-lock brakes (ABS)</li>
          <li>Airbags</li>
          <li>Electronic stability control (ESC)</li>
          <li>Blind-spot monitoring</li>
          <li>Lane departure warning</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Review safety ratings from organizations like the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Consider Fuel Efficiency and Maintenance Costs</h2>
      <p>Evaluate fuel economy ratings (MPG or MPGe) to estimate fuel costs. Research maintenance costs, including routine servicing and potential repairs. Compare insurance rates for different models.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Test Drive and Inspect</h2>
      <p>Schedule test drives to experience the car's handling, comfort, and features. Thoroughly inspect the car for any signs of damage or wear. If buying a used car, consider having a mechanic inspect it.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Compare Prices and Negotiate</h2>
      <p>Shop around for the best price. Compare prices from different dealerships and online sources. Be prepared to negotiate the price and consider financing options.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Check Reviews and Ratings</h2>
      <p>Read reviews from car experts and owners. Pay attention to both positive and negative feedback. Research common issues and complaints.</p>
    </div>
