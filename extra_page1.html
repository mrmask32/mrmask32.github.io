    <h1>How to Buy a Car: A Step-by-Step Guide</h1>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>1. Determine Your Budget and Needs</h2>
      <p>Before you start looking at cars, figure out how much you can afford. Consider not only the purchase price but also insurance, fuel, maintenance, and potential repairs. Determine the type of car that fits your lifestyle and needs (e.g., sedan, SUV, truck).</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Research and Compare Vehicles</h2>
      <p>Use online resources, car magazines, and reviews to research different makes and models. Compare features, prices, and reliability ratings. Visit manufacturer websites and online car marketplaces.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Find Cars for Sale</h2>
      <p>Look at dealerships, online marketplaces, and private sellers. Consider both new and used cars. Check vehicle history reports (e.g., Carfax) for used cars.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Test Drive and Inspect the Car</h2>
      <p>Schedule test drives to get a feel for the car's handling and comfort. Inspect the car thoroughly for any signs of damage or wear. If possible, have a trusted mechanic inspect the car before making a purchase.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>5. Negotiate the Price</h2>
      <p>Be prepared to negotiate the price. Research the car's market value and use that as a starting point. Don't be afraid to walk away if you're not comfortable with the deal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>6. Secure Financing</h2>
      <p>If you need financing, shop around for the best interest rates. Consider loans from banks, credit unions, and dealerships. Get pre-approved for a loan before visiting dealerships.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>7. Complete the Paperwork</h2>
      <p>Carefully review all paperwork before signing. This includes the purchase agreement, loan documents, and warranty information. Ensure you understand all terms and conditions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>8. Obtain Insurance and Registration</h2>
      <p>Before driving your new car, obtain insurance coverage and register the vehicle with your local motor vehicle agency. Make sure you have all necessary documentation.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>9. Take Delivery and Enjoy Your Car</h2>
      <p>After completing all the steps, take delivery of your car and enjoy your new ride! Remember to keep up with regular maintenance and servicing.</p>
